# basicWorks
Here are a few different projects that I have worked on for school in the past few years. I they are separated based on commits,
so those under the same commits belong to the same project. If you click the commit, it will give a brief overview of what each project is meant to do.
You can email me at franzmel@miamioh.edu for any questions!
